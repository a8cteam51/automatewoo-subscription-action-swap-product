# AutomateWoo Subscription Action Swap Product

Extends the functionality of AutomateWoo with a custom action which allows you to swap products on subscriptions. 

## Usage

This action is intended to be used on manual workflows to swap out products on subscriptions in a store, on a 1:1 basis. So, when looking at the line items of an existing subscription, `Product A x3` becomes `Product B x3`. 

There is currently no advanced math or formulae available for this action, it just does a 1:1 swap.

This will not change price or quantity of line item, or any other characteristics of the subscription. It simply swaps out the product.

## Support
